## Today's Topics

I'll keep today's class fairly open ended, so we can discuss:

* questions about the midterm exam (10/21)
* questions about homework #4 (due tonight, though we can talk about extending through tomorrow)

Otherwise, I'll reinforce the topics that we went skimmed through last week:

* forms
* sessions

(I've augmented the slides from the previous class based on feedback)
